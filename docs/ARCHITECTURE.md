# myworktree — Architecture

## 1. Overview
myworktree is a lightweight single-user manager for:
- **git worktrees** (isolated working directories)
- **instances** (long-running shell/CLI processes started by myworktree)
- **web UI + HTTP API** to manage them and replay recent output

It does **not** analyze project code or prevent concurrent write conflicts inside a worktree.

## 2. High-level components
- `cmd/myworktree/` — CLI entry.
- `internal/app/` — HTTP server, auth middleware, API routing.
- `internal/worktree/` — worktree lifecycle via `git` CLI.
- `internal/instance/` — instance lifecycle (spawn/stop/list) + output log file.
- `internal/tag/` — Tag config loader (MVP: JSON).
- `internal/store/` — persistent state store (`state.json`) with file locking + atomic writes.
- `internal/redact/` — secret redaction for stored logs/backlog.
- `internal/mcp/` — MCP adapter surface (tool names + app-level tool dispatch), keeping core decoupled.
- `internal/ui/` — embedded static UI.

## 3. Data & persistence
### 3.1 Project-scoped user data directory
- Stored under user-level config dir (no repo pollution), partitioned by `repoHash`.
- Contains:

### 3.1.1 Worktree directory layout
- Default: worktrees are created next to the repo under `<repo-name>-myworktree/<worktree-name>/`.
- Override: `-worktrees-dir=data` uses the legacy location under the per-project data dir; you can also set a custom path.
  - `state.json` — managed worktrees + managed instances
  - `tags.json` — project-level tags
  - `logs/<instanceId>.log` — rolling instance backlog

### 3.2 State model
- Worktree: id, name, path, branch, baseRef, createdAt
- Instance: id, worktreeId, tagId, command, cwd, env (sanitized), pid, status, logPath, timestamps

## 4. Instance lifecycle & reconnect semantics
- An instance is a server-managed process; UI windows are merely views.
- Default interactive path is WebSocket TTY: `GET /api/instances/tty/ws?id=...` (bi-directional terminal stream).
- Fallback path remains available: HTTP input `POST /api/instances/input` + replay/SSE logs (`GET /api/instances/log`, `GET /api/instances/log/stream`).
- UI shows transport state (`websocket/sse/polling`) and supports manual WS reconnect.
- Backlog is stored on disk with a size cap (rolling truncate).
- On server startup, stale persisted `running` records are reconciled to `stopped` because in-memory stdin/stdout bindings cannot be resumed after process restart.

## 5. Terminal Protocol Timing Specification

This section defines the strict timing protocol for terminal I/O to prevent escape sequence leakage and ensure reliable data flow.

### 5.1 Terminal Connection State Machine

The terminal connection goes through the following states:

```
IDLE → CONNECTING → HANDSHAKING → READY → DISCONNECTING → IDLE
```

| State | Description | Allowed Actions |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| IDLE | No active connection | May initiate connection |
| CONNECTING | WebSocket opening in progress | None (wait) |
| HANDSHAKING | WebSocket open, waiting for server `ready` message | None (wait) |
| READY | Connection fully established | Send input, receive output, resize |
| DISCONNECTING | Connection closing in progress | None (wait) |

### 5.2 WebSocket Handshake Protocol

**Server → Client (on WebSocket open):**
```json
{"type": "ready"}
```

The client MUST wait for this message before:
- Sending any input data
- Sending resize commands
- Focusing the terminal (to prevent query sequence leakage)

**Client → Server (after receiving `ready`):**
```json
{"type": "resize", "cols": 80, "rows": 24}
```

**Timeout:** Client MUST implement a 5-second handshake timeout. If `ready` is not received, fall back to SSE mode.

### 5.3 Instance Switch Protocol

When switching between instances (worktree or instance tabs), the following sequence MUST be followed strictly:

```
Phase 1: Disconnect Previous
├── 1.1 Call disconnectTTY() - close old WebSocket
├── 1.2 Reset logCursor = 0
└── 1.3 Clear terminal buffers (if terminal exists)
    ├── For running instances:
    │   ├── Write '\x1b[?1049l' (exit alternate buffer)
    │   ├── Write '\x1b[2J\x1b[H' (clear normal buffer, home cursor)
    │   └── Write '\x1b[?1049h' (re-enter alternate buffer, now clean)
    └── For stopped instances:
        ├── Call term.reset()
        └── Write '\x1b[2J\x1b[3J\x1b[H' (clear screen and scrollback)

Phase 2: Load Initial Data
├── 2.1 If stopped: loadLog() once, update status to "stopped", DONE
└── 2.2 If running: loadLog() then proceed to Phase 3

Phase 3: Establish New Connection (running instances only)
├── 3.1 Call connectTTY()
│   ├── Create new WebSocket
│   ├── Set state to CONNECTING
│   └── Register onopen handler
├── 3.2 Wait for WebSocket.onopen
├── 3.3 Wait for server {"type": "ready"} message
├── 3.4 Set state to READY
├── 3.5 Send initial resize: {"type": "resize", "cols": N, "rows": M}
└── 3.6 NOW and ONLY NOW: Call focusTerminalIfPossible()
```

**Critical Timing Rule:** The terminal MUST NOT receive focus until Phase 3.6 (after `ready` message is received and resize is sent).

### 5.4 Focus Management Rules

The terminal focus is managed by `focusTerminalIfPossible()` which checks:

```javascript
function focusTerminalIfPossible() {
    if (!term) return;                    // No terminal instance
    if (!windowHasFocus) return;          // Browser window not focused
    if (openDialogs.size > 0) return;     // Modal dialog is open
    if (!state.activeInst) return;        // No active instance
    if (ttyState !== 'READY') return;     // ⚠️ Connection not ready
    const inst = state.instances.find(i => i.id === state.activeInst);
    if (inst && inst.status !== 'running') return; // Instance not running
    
    term.focus();
}
```

**The `ttyState` check is CRITICAL** - it prevents focus before the WebSocket is ready, which would cause xterm.js to send terminal query sequences (OSC 11, DA, DEC Private Mode queries) before the data path is established.

### 5.5 Terminal Query Sequence Prevention

When xterm.js gains focus, it sends query sequences to detect terminal capabilities:
- `OSC 11` - Background color query → Response: `\x1b]11;rgb:...`
- `OSC 4` - Palette color query → Response: `\x1b]4;...;rgb:...`
- `DA (Device Attributes)` → Response: `\x1b[?1;2c`
- `DEC Private Mode Report` → Response: `\x1b[?2027;0$y...`

If these responses arrive before the WebSocket is in READY state, they may be incorrectly routed or displayed as garbage text.

**Prevention Strategy:**
1. Never focus terminal before WebSocket is READY
2. Always complete handshake before sending resize
3. Send resize before focusing (this triggers any needed redraw)

### 5.6 Error Handling & Recovery

| Scenario | Detection | Recovery Action |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Handshake timeout | No `ready` in 5s | Close WS, fallback to SSE |
| WebSocket close | onclose event | Retry after 1s delay |
| Instance stopped | status !== 'running' | Disconnect WS, show log with banner |
| Browser blur | blur event | Track windowHasFocus = false |
| Dialog open | showModal intercept | Track openDialogs.add() |

### 5.7 Protocol Message Summary

**Server → Client Messages:**

| Message | Format | When |
|---------|--------|------|
| Ready | `{"type":"ready"}` | Immediately after WebSocket opens |
| Output (binary) | `ArrayBuffer` | PTY output available |
| Output (text) | `string` | PTY output available |

**Client → Server Messages:**

| Message | Format | When |
|---------|--------|------|
| Resize | `{"type":"resize","cols":N,"rows":M}` | After `ready`, on terminal resize |
| Input | raw string/bytes | User keystroke (anytime after `ready`) |

### 5.8 Implementation Checklist

When implementing or modifying terminal connection code, verify:

- [ ] `focusTerminalIfPossible()` checks connection state before focusing
- [ ] WebSocket handshake timeout (5s) is implemented
- [ ] `ready` message triggers resize BEFORE focus
- [ ] Instance switch follows Phase 1 → 2 → 3 sequence
- [ ] Dialog close delays focus until connection is ready
- [ ] Window focus event respects connection state

## 6. Security model (single-user)
- Default listen: loopback only.
- Non-loopback requires `--auth`.
- Optional built-in HTTPS via `--tls-cert/--tls-key`.
- Origin/Host check + basic rate limit on unauthorized attempts.
- Redaction on stored backlog (e.g. `sk-...`).

## 7. MCP extensibility
- Core managers (worktree/instance) are transport-agnostic.
- `internal/mcp` exposes tool names; server dispatch maps tool calls to existing core managers without rewriting core.
